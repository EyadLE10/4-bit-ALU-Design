# 4-bit-ALU-Design
This project implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of performing arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, AND, OR, XOR, and more. The ALU is controlled using a demultiplexer and built using TTL logic ICs, simulated in Logisim and Proteus, and implemented on a breadboard.
